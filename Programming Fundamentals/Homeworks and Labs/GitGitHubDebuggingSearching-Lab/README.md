## 01.**Debug the Code:** __Holidays between Two Dates__

You are assigned to **find and fix the bugs** in an existing piece of code, using the Visual Studio **debugger**. You should

trace the program execution to find the lines of code that produce incorrect or unexpected results.

You are given a program (existing source code) that aims to count the non-working days between two dates given

in format **day.month.year** (e.g. between __1.05.2015__ and __15.05.2015__ there are **5** non-working days â€“ Saturday and

Sunday).
You can **find the broken code** in the judge system: https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/204/Git-GitHub-Debugging-Searching-Lab.
