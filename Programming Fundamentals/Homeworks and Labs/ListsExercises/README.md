## 01.Max Sequence of Equal Elements
Read a **list of integers** and find the **longest sequence of equal elements**. If several exist, print the **leftmost**.


#### Examples

|**Input**|**Output**|
|---|---|
|3 4 4 5 5 5 2 2	|5 5 5|
|7 7 4 4 5 5 3 3	|7 7|
|1 2 3 3	|3 3|

> ##### Hints
> - Scan positions **p** from left to right and keep the **start** and **length** of the current sequence of equal numbers ending at p.
> - Keep also the currently best (longest) sequence (**bestStart + bestLength**) and update it after each step

## 02.** Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
Read a **list of integers** and find the **longest increasing subsequence (LIS)**. If several such exist, print the **leftmost**.

#### Examples

|**Input**|**Output**|
|---|---|
|1|1|
|7 3 5 8 -1 0 6 7	|3 5 6 7|
|1 2 5 3 5 2 4 1	|1 2 3 5|
|0 10 20 30 30 40 1 50 2 3 4 5 6	|0 1 2 3 4 5 6|
|11 12 13 3 14 4 15 5 6 7 8 7 16 9 8	|3 4 5 6 7 816|
|3 14 5 12 15 7 8 9 11 10 1	|3 5 7 8 9 11|

> #### Hints
> - Assume we have n numbers in an array **nums[0…n-1]**.
> - Let **len[p]** holds the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) ending at position **p**.
> - In a for loop, we calculate shall **len[p]** for **p = 0 … n-1** as follows:
> Let **left** is the leftmost position on the left of **p (left < p)**, such that **len[left]** is the maximal possible.
> Then, **len[p] = 1 + len[left]**. If **left** does not exist, **len[p] = 1**.
> Also save **prev[p] = left** (we hold if **prev[]** the previous position, used to obtain the best length for position **p**).
> - Once the values for **len[0…n-1]** are calculated, restore the LIS starting from position **p** such that **len[p]** is maximal and go back and back through **p = prev[p]**.
> - The table below illustrates these computations:

|**index**|**0**|**1**|**2**|**3**|**4**|**5**|**6**|**7**|**8**|**9**|**10**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|nums[]	|3	|14	|5	|12	|15	|7	|8	|9	|11	|10	|1|
|len[]	|1	|2	|2	|3	|4	|3	|4	|5	|6	|6	|1|
|prev[]	|-1	|0	|0	|2	|3	|2	|5	|6	|7	|7	|-1|
|LIS	|{3}|	{3,14}|	{3,5}	|{3,5,12}	|{3,5,12,15}|	{3,5,7}	|{3,5,7,8}	|{3,5,7,8,9}	|{3,5,7,8,9,11}	|{3,5,7,8,9,10}	|{1}|

## 03.*Array Manipulator
Write a program that r**eads an array of integers** from the console and **set of commands** and **executes them over the array**. The commands are as follows:
- **add <index> <element>** – adds element at the specified index (elements right from this position inclusively are shifted to the right).
- **addMany <index> <element 1> <element 2> … <element n>** – adds a set of elements at the specified index.
- **contains <element>** – prints the index of the first occurrence of the specified element (if exists) in the array or -1 if the element is not found.
- **remove <index>** – removes the element at the specified index.
- **shift <positions> – shifts every element** of the array the number of positions **to the left** (with rotation).
For example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> shift 2 -> [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
- **sumPairs** – sums the elements in the array by pairs (first + second, third + fourth, …).
For example, [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] -> [3, 9, 13, 8].
- **print** – stop receiving more commands and print the last state of the array.

#### Examples

|**Input**|**Output**|
|---|---|
|1 2 4 5 6 7 <br/> add 1 8 <br/> contains 1 <br/> contains -3 <br/> print|0 <br/> -1 <br/> [1, 8, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]|
|1 2 3 4 5 <br/> addMany 5 9 8 7 6 5 <br/> contains 15 <br/> remove 3 <br/> shift 1 <br/> print|-1 <br/> [2, 3, 5, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 1]|
|2 2 4 2 4 <br/> add 1 4 <br/> sumPairs <br/> print|[6, 6, 6]|
|1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 <br/> sumPairs <br/> sumPairs <br/> addMany 0 -1 -2 -3 <br/> print|[-1, -2, -3, 6, 6, 6]|

## 04.Sum Reversed Numbers
Write a program that reads sequence of numbers, reverses their digits, and prints their sum.

#### Examples

|**Input**|**Output**|**Comments**|
|---|---|---|
|123 234 12	|774|	321 + 432 + 21 = 774|
|12 12 34 84 66 12	|220|	21 + 21 + 43+ 48 + 66 + 21 = 220|
|120 1200 12000	|63|	21 + 21 + 21 = 63|

## 05.Bomb Numbers
Write a program that **reads sequence of numbers** and **special bomb number** with a certain **power**. Your task is to **detonate every occurrence of the special bomb number** and according to its power **his neighbors from left and right**. Detonations are performed from left to right and all detonated numbers disappear. Finally print the **sum of the remaining elements** in the sequence.

#### Examples

|**Input**|**Output**|**Comments**|
|---|---|---|
|1 2 2 4 2 2 2 9 <br/> 4 2	|12|	Special number is 4 with power 2. After detontaion we left with the sequence [1, 2, 9] with sum 12.|
|1 4 4 2 8 9 1 <br/> 9 3	|5|	Special number is 9 with power 3. After detontaion we left with the sequence [1, 4] with sum 5. Since the 9 has only 1 neighbour from the right we remove just it (one number instead of 3).
|1 7 7 1 2 3 <br/> 7 1	|6|	Detonations are performed from left to right. We could not detonate the second occurance of 7 because its already destroyed by the first occurance. The numbers [1, 2, 3] survive. Their sum is 6.|
|1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 <br/> 2 1	|4|	The red and yellow numbers disappear in two sequential detonations. The result is the sequence [1, 1, 1, 1]. Sum = 4.|
