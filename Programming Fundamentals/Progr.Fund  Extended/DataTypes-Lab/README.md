Problems for exercises and homework for the [&quot;Programming Fundamentals&quot; course @ SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/courses/programming-fundamentals).

# I.Integer and Real Numbers

### 1.Time Since Birthday

Write program to enter an integer number of **years** and convert it to **days** , **hours** and **minutes**.

#### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 20 | 20 years = 7300 days = 175200 hours = 10512000 minutes. |
| 14 | 14 years = 5110 days = 122640 hours = 7358400 minutes. |

#### Hints

- Use appropriate data type to fit the result after each data conversion.
- Assume that every year has 365 days.

#### Solution

You might help yourself with the code below:

```c#
Console.Write("Years - ");
byte years = byte.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
int days = years * 365;
int hours = days * 24;
int minutes = hours * 60;

Console.WriteLine("{0} years = {1} days = {2} hours = {3} minutes.", years, days, hours , minutes);
```
### 2.Circle Perimeter (12 Digits Precision)

Write program to enter a radius **r** (real number) and **print the perimeter** of a circle with exactly **12 digits** after the decimal point. Use data type of **enough precision** to hold the results.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 0.05 | 0.314159265359 |   
| 1.2 | 7.539822368616 |
### Hints

- You might use the data type **double**. It has precision of 15-16 digits.
- To print the output with exactly 12 digits after the decimal point, you might use the following code:

```c#
double r = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
Console.WriteLine("{0:f2}", 2 * Math.PI * r);
```
### 3.Exact Product of Real Numbers

Write program to enter **n** numbers and calculate and print their **exact product** (without rounding).

### Hints

- If you use types like **float** or **double** , the result will lose some of its precision. Also it might be printed in scientific notation.
- You might use the **decimal** data type which holds real numbers with high precision with less loss.
- Note that **decimal** numbers sometimes hold the unneeded zeroes after the decimal point, so **0m** is different than **0.0m** and **0.00000m**.


# II.Type Conversion

### 4.Transport

Calculate how many courses will be needed to **transport n persons** by using 3 vehicles of **capacity 4, 8 and 12** respectively. The input holds one line:the **number of people n**. The vehicles **can** travel at the same time.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | **Comments** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 50 | 3 | 2 course \* 24 persons + 1 course \* 2 person |
| 24 | 1 | All the persons fit inside in one total course of the vehicles.Only one course is needed. |
| 150 | 7 | 150 / (4 + 8 + 12) = 6.25 =&gt; 7 courses6 courses \* 24 people (4 + 8 + 12) + 1 course \* 6 people |

### Hints

- You should **divide**  **n**  **by**  **the sum of all the cars&#39; capacity**. This gives you the number of full courses (e.g. 25 / 24 = 1.04).
- If **n** does not divide without a remainder, you will need one additional partially full course (e.g. 25 % 24 = 1).
- Another approach is to round up **n**** /**(**4+8+12)** to the nearest integer (ceiling), e.g. 25/24 = 1.04rounds up to2.
- Sample code for the round-up calculation:

```c#
var capacity = 4 + 8 + 12;
var courses = (int) Math.Ceiling((double)n / capacity);
```
