## 1.Largest Element in Array

Read an integer **N** and on the next **N** lines read an **array** of **integers.** Then, find its **largest** element.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 4<br/>5<br/>6<br/>8<br/>7 | 8 |
| 3<br/>-2<br/>-18<br/>-5348 | -2 |
| 6<br/>2<br/>2<br/>2<br/>2<br/>2<br/>2 | 2 |

## 2.Count of Negative Elements in Array

Read an integer **N** and on the next **N** lines read an **array** of **integers.** Then, find the **count** of **negative** elements in the array.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 5<br/>1<br/>-2<br/>3<br/>-4<br/>5 | 2 |
| 3<br/>1<br/>3<br/>2 | 0 |
| 6<br/>-1<br/>-2<br/>-3<br/>-4<br/>-4<br/>4 | 5 |

## 3.Count of Given Element in Array

Read an array of integers and print how many times a given element exists in it.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 5 2 3 1 5<br/>2 | 1 |
| 1 4 4 4 1<br/>4 | 3 |
| 8 4 9 0 0<br/>0 | 2 |

### Hints

- Use the **.Split()** function to read the array on a single line.

## 4.Count Occurrences of Larger Numbers in Array

Read an **array** of **real numbers** and a number **p**. Find how many elements are **bigger** than **p** in the array and **print** the count.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 3 2 3.5 3 2 4 3 4 -2 -7 3<br/>2.9 | 7 |
| 5 6 105 3 2 849<br/>100 | 2 |
| 1.5 4.1 9.3 10.5 0.85<br/>4.9 | 2 |

## 5.Increasing Sequence of Elements

Read an **array of integers** and find out if it is an **increasing sequence**. Print **Yes** if it does and **No** if it doesn&#39;t.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 5 10 12 | Yes |
| 1 5 2 12 | No |

## 6.Equal Sequence of Elements in Array

Read an **array of integers** and find out if all the elements in the array are **the same**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 5 5 5 | Yes |
| 3 4 4 | No |

## 7.Count of Capital Letters in Array

Read an **array of strings** and find out how many of them are **capital English letters** (such as A, B, C etc.). Print the count on the console.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| Hello SoftUni I am A student | 2 |
| I Think A B and C are the first three letters of the alphabet | 4 |

## 8.Array Symmetry

Read an **array of strings** and find out if it&#39;s **symmetric**. If it is, print &quot; **Yes**&quot;, otherwise print &quot; **No**&quot;.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| hi you hi | Yes |
| ho hi hi ho | Yes |
| hi ho ho ho | No |

### Hints

- Iterate over the array as follows:
  - Check whether the **first** and **last** elements are equal
  - Then check whether the **second** and the **next to last** elements are equal
  - Continue this pattern until you either **find an inequality** or **reach the middle** of the array.
- Alternate solution: **reverse** the array and check if it is the **same** as the **original** array.

## 9.\* Altitude

You are an airplane pilot, trying to maneuver your airplane to safety from an unknown danger.

An array holds a sequence of **up** / **down** commands and **numbers**. Its first element **always** holds the **initial altitude**. Thecommand **up**** increases **the altitude by the next number, while the command** down decreases **the altitude by the** next number**.

If at any point the altitude becomes either **zero** or **negative** , print &quot; **crashed**&quot; and **end**** the program **. If by the end, the altitude is** positive **, however, print &quot;** got through safely. current altitude: {altitude}m**&quot;.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 300up 3down 7up 5 | got through safely. current altitude: 301m |
| 50 up 2 down 20 up 3 down 36 up 1 down 2 up 2 | crashed |
| 11 up 12 down 20 down 3 down 36 down 1 down 2 down 2 | crashed |

## 10.\* Ballistics Training

You are the anti-aircraft operator, trying to shoot down the airplane from the previous problem. You&#39;ll be given instructions to get to the current coordinates of the plane. Shoot it down.

You will be given an array which holds 2 numbers – the **target**** X **and** Y ****coordinates** of the plane.

Afterwards, you will be given a second array, which holds a sequence of **left** / **right** / **up** / **down** commands and **numbers**. We start at position **{x=0, y=0}**. Manipulate the firing position in the following way:

- Up **increases**** y** by the next number.
- Down **decreases**** y** by the next number.
- Left **decreases x** by the next number.
- Right **increases x** by the next number.

After you process all the commands, print &quot;**firing at [{x}, {y}]**&quot;. After that, check if the **firing position**** coordinates **line up with the** target coordinates **. If they do, print &quot;** got &#39;em! **&quot;. If not – print &quot;** better luck next time...**&quot;

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 25 -3<br/>right 18 down 6 left -7 up 3 | **firing at [25, -3] <br/> got &#39;em! |
| 150 33<br/>right 108 down 4 left -11 up 3 right 30 up 33 right 2 | firing at [151, 32]<br/>better luck next time... |
