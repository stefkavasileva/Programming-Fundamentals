# <p align="center"> Array and List Algorithms - Lab  <p>

Problems for exercises and homework for the [&quot;Programming Fundamentals&quot; course @ SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/courses/programming-fundamentals).

You can check your solutions [here] (https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/Practice/Index/426#0).

**Note: for this exercise, you are not allowed to use LINQ for the actual algorithms (parsing the input with LINQ is okay). The exercise is intended to help you flex your algorithmic thinking skills, and as such, please try to solve the problems algorithmically.**

## 1.Array Contains Element

Read a **list of integers** on the first line of the console and an integer **N** from the second line of the console and print whether the element is **contained** in the array. If it is, print &quot; **yes**&quot;, otherwise print &quot; **no**&quot;.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 2 3 4 5 <br/> 5 | yes |
| 8 7 7 9 6 2 2<br/>11 | no |
| 99 7 8 6 2314 2<br/>2314 | yes |

### Hints

- Read a text line from the console, split it by space, parse the obtained items as integers and convert them to array of integers.
- Scan through the whole array, element by element, until you either find the element, or reach the end of the array.
- Keep the result of the operation in a Boolean variable such as &quot; **isFound**&quot;.
- Finally, if the element is found (checking by the variable), print &quot; **yes**&quot; or &quot; **no**&quot;.

## 2.Smallest Element in Array

Read a **list of integers** on the first line of the console. After that, **find** the smallest element in the array and **print** it on the console.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 2 3 4 5 | 1 |
| 9 8 7 82 78 13 | 7 |
| 78 77 1268 43 9 | 9 |

### Hints

- Read a text line from the console, split it by space, parse the obtained items as integers and convert them to array of integers.
- Traverse the whole array, element by element, putting the **smallest integer** up to that point into an integer variable called &quot; **smallestInt**&quot;. Finally, print **smallestInt**.

## 3.Reverse Array In-place

Read a **list of integers** on the first line of the console. After that, **reverse** the array in-place (as in, don&#39;t create a new collection to hold the result, reverse it using only the original array). After you are done, **print** the reversed array on the console.

Note: You are **not** allowed to iterate over the list backwards and just print it,

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 2 3 4 5 | 5 4 3 2 1 |
| 1 4 2 7 6 1 1 | 1 1 6 7 2 4 1 |
| 11 52 43 12 1 6 | 6 1 12 43 52 11 |

### Hints

- Iterate over **half** of the array (0…length / 2) and swap each element with its opposite index like so:
  - Index 0 gets swapped with length - 1
  - Index 1 gets swapped with length - 2,
  - Index 2 gets swapped with length - 3,
  - and so on…
- When you reach the **middle** of the array, it means you are done swapping elements and are ready to print them.

## 4.Sort Array Using Bubble Sort

Read a **list of integers** on the first line of the console. After that, **sort** the array, using the [**Bubble Sort**](https://visualgo.net/sorting) algorithm.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 5 3 4 1 2 | 1 2 3 4 5 |
| 11 872 673 1 2 | 1 2 11 673 872 |
| 11 52 43 12 1 6 | 1 6 11 12 43 52 |

## 5.Sort Array Using Insertion Sort

Read a **list of integers** on the first line of the console. After that, **sort** the array, using the [**Insertion Sort**](https://visualgo.net/sorting) algorithm.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 5 3 4 1 2 | 1 2 3 4 5 |
| 11 872 673 1 2 | 1 2 11 673 872 |
| 11 52 43 12 1 6 | 1 6 11 12 43 52 |

## 6.Insertion Sort Using List

Read a **list of integers** on the first line of the console. After that, **sort** the array, using the [**Insertion Sort**](https://visualgo.net/sorting) algorithm, but instead of doing it in-place, add the result **one by one** to a **list**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 5 3 4 1 2 | 1 2 3 4 5 |
| 11 872 673 1 2 | 1 2 11 673 872 |
| 11 52 43 12 1 6 | 1 6 11 12 43 52 |

## 7.Largest N Elements

Read a **list of integers** on the first line of the console. On the next line, you will receive an **integer N**. After that, find and **print** the **largest N**** elements **the array, sorted in** descending order**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 5 3 4 1 2 <br/> 3 | 5 4 3 |
| 11 872 673 1 2 <br/> 2 | 872 673 |
| 11 52 43 12 1 6 <br/> 4 | 52 43 12 11 |

### Hints

- A possible solution to this problem is:
  - Sort the array in **descending order** , using a sorting algorithm such as **Insertion Sort** ,
  - Extract the first **N elements** from it
