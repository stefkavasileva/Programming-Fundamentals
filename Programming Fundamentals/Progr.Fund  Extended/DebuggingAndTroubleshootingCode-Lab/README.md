# <p align="center"> Debugging and Troubleshooting Code - Lab  <p>

Problems for exercises and homework for the [&quot;Programming Fundamentals&quot; course @ SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/courses/programming-fundamentals).

You can check your solutions [here] (https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/Practice/Index/419#0).

## 1.Multiply Evens by Odds

Create a program that reads an **integer number** and **multiplies the sum of all its even digits** by **the sum of all its odd digits** :

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | **Comments** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 12345 | 54 | 12345 has **2 even digits** - 2 and 4. Even digits has **sum of 6**.Also it has **3 odd digits** - 1, 3 and 5. Odd digits has **sum of 9**. **Multiply 6 by 9** and you get **54**. |
| -12345 | 54 |   |

### Hints

Create a method with a **name describing its purpose** (like **GetMultipleOfEvensAndOdds** ). The method should have a **single integer parameter** and an **integer return value**. Also the method will call two other methods:

```C#
private static int GetMultipleOfEvensAndOdds(int n)
{
	int sumEvens = GetSumOfEvenDigits(n);
	int sumOdds = GetSumOfOddDigits(n);
	return sumEvens * sumOdds;
}
```
Create two other methods each of which will sum either even or odd digits
Implement the logic for summing odd digits:
```C#
private static int GetSumOfOddDigits(int n)
{
	int sum = 0;
	while (n > 0)
	{
		int lastDigit = n % 10;
		if(lastDigit % 2 != 0)
		{
			// TODO: add to sum
		}
		
		n /= 10;
	}
	
	return sum;
}
```
Do the same for the method that will sum even digits
As you test your solution you may notice that it doesn&#39;t work for negative numbers. Following the program execution line by line, find and fix the bug (**hint: you can use Math.Abs()**)

## 2.Debugging Exercise: Holidays Between Two Dates

You are assigned to **find and fix the bugs** in an existing piece of code, using the Visual Studio **debugger**. You should trace the program execution to find the lines of code that produce incorrect or unexpected results.

You are given a program (existing **source code** ) that aims to **count the non-working days between two dates** given in format **day.month.year** (e.g. between **1.05.2015** and **15.05.2015** there are **5** non-working days â€“ Saturday and Sunday).

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | **Comments** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 01.05.2016 <br/> 15.05.2016 | 5 | There are **5** non-working days (Saturday / Sunday) in this period: 1-May-2016, 7-May-2016, 8-May-2016, 14-May-2016, 15-May-2016 |
| 01.05.2016<br/> 02.05.2016 | 1 | Only **1** non-working day in the specified period: 1.05.2016 (Sunday) |
| 15.05.2020 <br/> 10.05.2020 | 0 | The second date is before the first. No dates in the range. |
| 22.02.2020<br/> 01.03.2020 | 4 | TwoSaturdays and Sundays:  02.2020 and 23.02.2020; 02.2020 and 1.03.2020 |

You can **find the broken code** in the judge system: [Broken Code for Refactoring](https://softuni.bg/downloads/svn/soft-tech/Jan-2017/Programming-Fundamentals-Extended-Jan-2017/05.%20Programming-Fundamentals-Debugging-and-Troubleshooting-Code/05.%20Programming-Fundamentals-Debugging-and-Troubleshooting-Code-Lab-Broken-Solutions.zip). It looks as follows:

```C#
using System;
using System.Globalization;

class HolidaysBetweenTwoDates
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var startDate = DateTime.ParseExact(Console.ReadLine(),
            "dd.m.yyyy", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
        var endDate = DateTime.ParseExact(Console.ReadLine(),
            "dd.m.yyyy", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
        var holidaysCount = 0;
        for (var date = startDate; date <= endDate; date.AddDays(1))
            if (date.DayOfWeek == DayOfWeek.Saturday &&
                date.DayOfWeek == DayOfWeek.Sunday) holidaysCount++;
        Console.WriteLine(holidaysCount);
    }
}
```

### Hints

There are **4**** mistakes **in the code. You&#39;ve got to** use the debugger **to find them and fix them. After you do that, submit your** fixed code in the judge contest**: [https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/419](https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/419).

## 3.Debugging Exercise: Price Change Alert

You are assigned to **rework a given piece of code** which is working **without bugs** but is **not properly formatted**.

The given program **tracks stock prices** and **gives updates** about the **significance in each price change**. Based on the significance, there are **four kind of changes** : no change at all (price is equal to the previous), minor (difference is below the significance threshold), price up and price down.

You can **find the broken code** here: [Broken Code for Refactoring](https://softuni.bg/downloads/svn/soft-tech/Jan-2017/Programming-Fundamentals-Extended-Jan-2017/05.%20Programming-Fundamentals-Debugging-and-Troubleshooting-Code/05.%20Programming-Fundamentals-Debugging-and-Troubleshooting-Code-Lab-Broken-Solutions.zip).

### Input

- On the first line you are given **N** - the number of prices
- On the second line you are given the significance threshold
- On the next N lines, you are given prices

### Output

- Don&#39;t print anything for the first price
- If there is **no difference** from the previous price the output message is: &quot;NO CHANGE: {current price}&quot;
- In case of **minor change** : &quot;MINOR CHANGE: {last price} to {current price} ({difference}%)&quot;
- In case of **major change** : &quot;PRICE UP: {last price} to {current price} ({difference}%)&quot; or &quot;PRICE DOWN: {last price} to {current price} ({difference}%)&quot;

The percentage should be rounded to the second digit after the decimal point.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 3 <br/> 0.1<br/>10<br/>11<br/>12 | PRICE UP: 10 to 11 (10.00%)<br/>MINOR CHANGE: 11 to 12 (9.09%) |
| 3<br/>0.1<br/>10<br/>10<br/>12 | NO CHANGE: 10<br/>PRICE UP: 10 to 12 (20.00%) |

### Hints

1. Download the source code and get familiar with it
2. Deal with poor code formatting - Remove unnecessary blank lines, indent the code properly
3. Fix method parameters naming
4. Give methods a proper name
